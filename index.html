            <h2>Who?</h2>
              <p>My name is Peter McCrae-Hokenson and I am a software developer living in Minneapolis, MN and working all over. As an art major out in the world, I’m compelled by:</p>
              <ul class = "left-align">
                <li>Code that is as beautiful as it is air-tight</li>
                <li>Websites that tell an engaging story</li>
                <li>Collaborating with developers who are excited about taking risks and having fun with the design process</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>A bit more...</h3>
            <p>Throughout my undergraduate wanderings I oscillated between three fields: Economics, Computer Science, and Studio Art. While my academic focal point was a moving target, my motivations never wavered. I was (and still am) searching for the right vehicle to create experiences that connect people with the opportunities and resources they seek.</p>
            <p>During my senior year, I studied in Egypt, Tanzania, India, China, and Argentina. The impact these experiences had on me could not be overstated. After graduating, I was kindly selected as one of three Fifth Year Emerging Artists for my work as a photographer and filmmaker. What came next was a year of enthusiastic art-making sponsored by St. Olaf College. <a href = "https://petermccraehokenson.com" target="_blank">Here is some of my work!</a></p>
            <p>Now that I turn my gaze away from academia, I am excited about the intersection of art and technology. Anywhere where these two fields cross paths energizes me. If you are on the lookout for a developer who is equal parts meticulous and creative, I’d love to chat. You can find me at any of the links below.</p>
